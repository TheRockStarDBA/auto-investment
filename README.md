# auto-investment

This is a set of scripts I have written to automate discovery of investment opportunities.

## Working
- The script runs for free every midnight using github actions.
- It fetches the last 20 IPOs announced in Nepal and adds new IPOs to my todo list
- The todo task is added with a due date set to the deadline of the IPO. This is done so that we can compare oversubsription ratio and decide how many units to apply.
